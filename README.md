About Physical.Simulation.Tool
==============================

    Graphical tool for creating simulations in the area the physics in mobile devices (Apple iOS).

This project is the work of completing bachelor degree in computer science from the University of Blumenau Regional - FURB.

Focus will be to build a physics engine, which can be used for games and simulations. The project focuses on creating a tool for physical simulations.


The project consists of four modules:
-------------------------------------
- Library.collision -> will be responsible for dealing with collisions with various algorithms;
- Library.graphic -> will be responsible for drawing the graphic world of simulation;
- Library.physics -> will be responsible for performing physical operations;
- Physics.engine -> will be responsible for organizing and library.collision library.physics;

Prospective:
------------
- Between the independence modules
- Cross-platform
